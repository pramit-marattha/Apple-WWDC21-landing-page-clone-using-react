                Create an interactive scene in a Swift playground that can be
                experienced within three minutes. Be creative. If you need
                inspiration, use the templates in Swift Playgrounds or Xcode for
                a head start on more advanced creations. Make them your own by
                adding graphics, audio, and more.

                  macOS 11.2.3, or Xcode 12.4 on macOS 11.2.3. If it runs on
                  iPadOS, it must be optimized to display properly on all models
